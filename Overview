Transmitting Binary Data
CXF provides facilities to transmit binary data efficiently via a standard called MTOM. 
Normally binary data inside an XML message must be Base64 encoded. This results in processing 
overhead and increases message size by 30%. If you use MTOM, CXF will send/receive MIME messages 
with the message stored as a MIME attachment, just like email. This results in much more efficient 
communication and allows you to transmit messages much larger than memory.
-------------------------------------------------
There are different ways to build RESTful services with CXF.

JAX-RS: CXF implements JAX-RS 2.0 (JSR-339) and JAX-RS 1.1 (JSR-311): Java API for RESTful Web Services. This provides a standard way to build RESTful services in Java.
JAX-WS Provider and Dispatch: It is possible to create RESTful services with the JAX-WS Provider and Dispatch APIs.
HTTP Binding: The HTTP binding provides a flexible way of creating resources and mapping them to operations in your service. This can currently be done via annotations or a convention based mapping.
Note : HTTP Binding has been removed from CXF 2.6.0.
