Transmitting Binary Data
CXF provides facilities to transmit binary data efficiently via a standard called MTOM. 
Normally binary data inside an XML message must be Base64 encoded. This results in processing 
overhead and increases message size by 30%. If you use MTOM, CXF will send/receive MIME messages 
with the message stored as a MIME attachment, just like email. This results in much more efficient 
communication and allows you to transmit messages much larger than memory.
